SPECTRUM CLASH

Spectrum Clash is my new project on Unity 6.
The game is an arena where enemies try to get to the player who stands in the center.
Core gameplay - changing the player's color to that of the enemy, who moves towards him.
My goal is to build a system that will be easy to expand. Adding enemies, upgrades and abilities should happen very quickly and easily.
Although I work alone, the system is also great for game designers.
Scripts are very easy to configure from the editor, so you can play with the balance as you like and nothing will break.
I kindly ask you not to use the project for commercial purposes, it is posted in the public domain solely for review and, perhaps, someone will be able to gain knowledge, although I do not consider myself a great gamedeloper.
